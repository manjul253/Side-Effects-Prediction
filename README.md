# Side-Effects-Prediction
A basic neural network model built using Keras with tensorflow as backend.


# Example Data (Generated using randint function)
An experimental drug was tested on individuals from ages 13 to 100
The trial had 2100 paticipants. Half under 65, other above 65.
95% of patients 65 or older experienced side effects
95% of patients under 65 experienced no side effects

# Training

The model used here is sequential with 3 layers within it.
All three are dense layers.

# Predictions are made on the randomly generated test data and confusion matrix is made for the same.

# Various methodologies to save and load the model also listed.
